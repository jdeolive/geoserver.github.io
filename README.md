## Developing 

The site is built with [Jekyll](). To perform a single build of the site:

    jekyll build

The site contents will result in the ``_site`` directory.

Jekyll can also be run in "watch" mode for development:

    jekyll serve -w

The site contents will be served at http://localhost:4000.
